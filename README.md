I used angular seed to create an app.
This app does one thing, displays New York Time' Best Seller book list, and it allows uses to search by title, author name. I got the data from New York Time API, and put them into the resource of this app, since the API do not allow access from local host.
The point of this app is to play around with angular's route, view and $http function with real data. I created all the data for my last project. With this one I wanted to be able to play with real data.
The biggest challenge with this project was to find a seed project that works on my labtop. I tried to use Yeomen generator like I did with my past projects, but for some reason I could not use it. Therefore I choosed the angular seed. However, this seed project did not have the features I wanted like Sass, Bourbon or Grunt. Therefore, I spent a lot of time to install those feature by hand. In the end I installed Sass, Bourbon and Neat, by not Grunt. Without Grunt I am not sure how to deploy this app on github.
I hope you like it.
